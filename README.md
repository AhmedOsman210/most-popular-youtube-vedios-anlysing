# Most Popular YouTube Videos Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the top 1000 most popular YouTube videos using a dataset that includes essential metrics such as views, likes, comments, category, and more. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships within the data that provide valuable insights into video popularity and engagement. Whether you're a content creator, marketer, or data enthusiast, this project offers a data-driven look at YouTube's most successful content.

## Project Overview

In this analysis, the dataset includes information about 1000 of the most popular videos across various categories and countries. The primary objective is to use data science techniques to explore factors such as:

- **Video popularity**: What factors contribute to a video's success? Are views, likes, or comments the most influential?
- **Category trends**: Which video categories dominate the platform in terms of popularity?
- **Engagement patterns**: How does engagement (likes, comments) correlate with the total number of views?

### Key Insights from the Data:
- **Trending Video Categories**: Identifying the most popular video categories on YouTube.
- **Most Engaging Content**: Analyzing how likes, dislikes, and comments correlate with views.
- **Growth Trends**: Determining the best time to upload videos and how that impacts their popularity.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Building models that can predict the potential success of a video based on early metrics.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Collection
The dataset used in this project is derived from YouTube's public data and includes the top 1000 most popular videos. Key fields in the dataset are:

- **Video Title**
- **Channel Name**
- **Video ID**
- **Views**
- **Likes**
- **Dislikes**
- **Comments**
- **Published Date**
- **Category** (e.g., Music, Entertainment, Gaming)

The data has been gathered from an API and prepared for analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning
Before starting any analysis, the data must be cleaned and formatted to ensure accuracy:

- Handling missing values (if any).
- Converting columns to appropriate formats (e.g., converting views, likes, comments to integers).
- Removing any duplicate entries or outliers that could skew the results.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA phase, several visualizations and summary statistics are used to uncover patterns within the data:

- **Histograms** and **bar plots** to explore distributions (e.g., views, likes, comments).
- **Heatmaps** to find correlations between video attributes.
- **Scatter plots** to analyze relationships between variables like views, likes, and comments.

**Key findings include:**
- Categories that attract the highest engagement.
- Distribution of views across the dataset.

### 4. Trend Analysis
This step explores temporal trends to understand how video popularity has evolved:

- **Time series analysis** of video publish dates and their impact on views.
- Analyzing top-performing videos over time to predict future trends.
- Understanding what makes videos viral within certain time frames.

### 5. Predictive Modeling
We create predictive models to forecast the potential success of a video based on initial metrics:

- **Regression models** to predict views or engagement.
- **Classification models** to categorize videos based on likelihood of success.

The models use features like views, likes, comments, and publish date.

### 6. Insights & Conclusion
After performing the analysis, we provide actionable insights:

- **Best practices for content creators**: What makes videos more likely to go viral?
- **Audience engagement strategies**: How to optimize engagement through likes, comments, and shares.
- **Category performance**: What categories to focus on for better reach.
